    "content":"초심자를 위한 신행생활 마음공부를 위한 여섯 가지 지침 여의주보다 더 귀한 사람들 모두를 위하여 지극한 행복이루길 다짐하며 항상 그들을 소중히 섬기리 어느 누구와 함께 있더라도 스스로를 가장 낮은 사람으로 여기고 가장 깊은 곳에서 그들을 가장 높은 사람으로 소중히 섬기리 모든 움직임에서 나와 남을 상하게 하는 괴로움의 물결이 일 때 이를 바로 봄으로써 괴로움에서 벗어나리 미움에 휩싸여 나를 모욕하여도 기꺼이 그들의 사나운 말 받아들이고 그들에게 승리의 기쁨 돌려주리 내가 늘 도와주고 희망을 걸었던 사람이 비록 나에게 심한 고통을 줄지라도 그들 항상 귀중한 마음의 벗으로 여기리 영욕에 물든 세속의 감정으로 모든 이들을 더럽히지 않으며 겉모양은 모두 허망한 것임을 알아 애착을 버리고 자유를 얻으리 시민선방 화두 나는 누구인가/ 문윤정(수필가) 물속에 사는 물고기는 물을 알 수 없듯이 눈을 통해 세상을 보지만 정작 자신의 눈은 볼 수 없습니다. 자기를 부리는 것은 자신이지만 우리는 그 주인공을 볼 수는 없습니다. 세상을 다 안다 하더라도 자신이 누구인지 모른다면 아무 소용 없습니다. 선이란 특별하거나 어려운 것이 아닙니다. 우리의 말, 생각, 행동이 하나가 되는 것입니다. 일반적으로 우리가 생활하면서 가만히 보면 마음과 몸이 따로 놉니다. 먹을 때, 잘 때, 걸을 때 우리의 몸은 먹고 자고 걸을지 몰라도 마음은 끊임없이 따로 움직입니다. 참선수행을 하면 몸과 마음이 완벽하게 하나가 됩니다. 그 때 여러분은 이미 세계 평화를 경험하는 것입니다. 나는 누구인가? 나는 어디서 났으며, 죽으면 어디로 가는가? 이 질문을 붙잡고 오직 모를 뿐… 하는 마음을 갖고 열심히 수행하십시오. 그러면 모든 생각이 끊어지고 집착이 사라집니다. 생각 이전의 본성으로 돌아올 수 있습니다. 말과 행동이 하나가 됩니다. 그것이 조화이고 평화입니다. 참선의 목적은 자신을 더 깊이 알고 다른 사람을 그만큼 잘 이해하는 것입니다. 수행의 목적은 그 단단한 석고를 부드럽게 요해해서 유연하게 만드는 것입니다. 수행을 하기 위해서는 무엇보다도 인내심, 조심성, 열린 마음이 필요합니다. 조사스님들 화두 참구법 열 가지 순서로 나눈 대혜大慧 선사禪師 화두話頭 지도법指導法 무자無子 화두를 들면서 “개에게 불성佛性 이 있다, 없다.”라고 헤아리지 말라. 이렇게 헤아리는 것은 더 이상 진전이 없다. 화두를 들 때는 이치理致 를 모색하는 길이 끊어져야 한다. 화두가 무슨 현묘한 도리가 있다고 생각하지 말라. 생각으로 헤아려서 해답을 찾지 말아야 한다. 조사祖師 가 보인 격외格外 의 행동에 대해서 알음알이로 의미를 부여하지 말라. 화두 언구言句 에 사로잡혀 말과 문자 상에서 이리저리 분별하거나 헤아려서는 안된다. 의정疑情 을 일으키지 않고 참구하는 화두를 단지 의식으로 알려고 해서는 안된다. 경전이나 어록語錄 등의 문자文字 를 끌어들여 입증하려고 하지말라. 해석이 분명하고 말이 귀착되는 점이 있더라도 넓게 헤아리고 해석해서는 안된다. 무無 가 실체實體 로써 존재한다거나 상대적인 유무를 초월한 무가 있다는 생각을 하지말라. 의식적으로 깨달음을 기다리는 마음을 갖지 말라. 이는 스스로가 본래本來 부처님임을 부정하는 것과 같다. 의식적으로 깨달음을 기다리기 때문에 그런 알음알이를 갖고 있는 마음이 도道 에 나가는데 장애가 된다. 성인聖人 과 범부凡夫 가 따로 있는 것이 아니라 모두가 동일한 본분本分 자리에 있음을 믿어야 한다. 반신반의半信半疑 하는 믿음이 아니라 결정적決定的 신信 을 통하여 깨달음을 기다리는 대오선待悟禪 의 함정을 극복해야 한다. 간화선의 핵심은 화두를 들어 활구를 참구하는데 있다. 의정이 일어나는 의문의 당처를 참구함을 활구라 한다. 아무 의문없이 멍하니 앉아있음을 사구라 한다. 활구는 모든 망상과 분별의식을 초월한 기능이다. 활구는 말과 생각의 길이 끊어져 어디에도 기댈 데가 없고 단 의정 덩어리만 뚜렷한 것이다. 맛도 냄새도 모양도 없는 텅 빈 의문 당처만이… 생각의 길이 살아있는 말을 쫓아서 설사 깨닫는다 할지라도 그것은 사유 형태로 이해하는 깨달음이기에 진정한 깨달음이라 할 수 없음이다. 이론과 관념을 뛰어넘는 증오이어야 한다. 간화선을 격외선이라고도 한다. 이론과 관념, 상식의 틀을 훌쩍 뛰어넘는 격외이다. 세속에 사는 룰은 이론과 관념, 상식의 룰 안에서 맴돌지만 관념적인 틀, 상식적인 틀 안에서만 맴도는 경지에서는 절대로 대해탈자가 못되고 낙도자가 되기 어렵다. 캄캄한 밤중에 누구의 주먹인지도 모르고 갑자기 느닷없이, 억울하게 한주먹 얻어맞아서 얼얼하게 취하게 하는 갑작스러운 일이다. 정신이 멍하게 하는 갑작의 당황이다. 정신이 멍한 갑작의 당황에서 자기의 성성한 지혜를 다시 살아나게 하는 공부지도의 묘수가 간화선으로 가게 하는 길이다. 앞 뒤 생각할 여지없이 눈이 번쩍 뜨이게 하는 것이 격외선이고 간화선이다. 갑작스레 느닷없이 “금정산이 어디로 누워있느냐? 금정산이 하루에 몇 번이나 춤을 추느냐? 금정산 까마귀가 지금 어디에 있느냐?” 하는 화두질문을 받으면 지체없이 답할 수 있는 화두공부 실력이 간화선자의 위신력이다. 앞의 조사스님들 간화선 지도방법은 쥐가 쇠뿔에 들어가 놓으면 쥐가 살기위해서 최선을 다해 분발하게 하는 방법이다. 죽은 사람이 다시 살아나게 하는 가장 지혜로운 지도방법이라고 소납은 항상 감탄함이다. 의정이 일어나게 하는 방법이다. 의정이 없으면 의단독로 화두가 될 수 없고 화두 향상이 될 수 없음이다. 의정이 일어나지 않으면 의정이 일어날 때까지 송 화두 신심부터 간절해야 함이다. 송 화두 신심이 절대로 헛것이 아니라는 결정이 굳어져야 함이다. 송 화두가 신앙적이라면 간화두 참구는 철학적인 차원이라 하겠다. 무엇보다 먼저 신앙적인 공덕터를 닦아야 함이다. 송 화두 공덕이 쌓이고 쌓이면 송 화두 공덕이 나중에는 의정이 생하는 간화선 화두가 됨이다. 송 화두가 증오에는 약간 더디다해도 자기 내면 성 안식에는 조금도 부족함이 없는 정진이다. 신앙심이 더욱 깊어지는 공부이다. 화두참구는 정신계의 동반자이다. 영원한 동반자이다. 진리의 동반자이다. 법의 동반자이다. 따뜻한 동반자이다. 안식의 동반자이다. 아무 조건없는 동반자이다. 화두 의단독록에는 고독이 없음이다. 허전함이 없음이다. 의전 더하고 덜함이 없다. 더럽고 깨끗함이 없다. ‘중생이다. 부처이다’는 차별이 끊어진 본분이다. ‘지옥이다. 극락이다’는 분별이 없음이다. 화두 동반, 신심의 동반자, 예경의 동반자가 아니고는 자신이 설 땅이 없음이다. 화두공부, 참선공부를 좀 더 쉽게, 좀 더 가깝게 말하자면 자기의 내면 성 작업이다. 사람에게는 이 작업이 끊어지지 않으면 낙도이지만 작업이 끊어지고 작업이 없으면 지옥이라고 나는 단언함이다. 작업은 독거락이다. 작업은 자기 정신계의 부활이다. 정신계의 부활은 아무 조건없는 무궁한 락이다. 락되게 살지 못함은 자기의 책임이지 어느 누구의 책임이 아니다. “일념 불이즉정토”라는 조사스님들의 법문 자기 한 생각의 진실과 신념이 곧 정토이지 자기 한 생각 밖의 그 무엇도 정토가 될 수 없다는 부동의 말씀이다. 참선이라고 하면 “저 멀리, 저 우러러”라고 높은 곳에 있는 것으로만 생각함은 잘못이다. 또, 안해도 되는 것으로만 생각함은 큰 병이다. 자기의 내면 성 작업이 참선의 공덕이라는 신념이 곧 지혜이다. 지극한 신심에서 고독이 없음이다. 고독자는 되지 말아야 한다. 독거락자가 되어야 만리 인간 승리이다. 화두참구자는 첩첩산중에 홀로 피는 야생화, 무인도에서 외롭게피는 야생화와 같다 하겠다. 첩첩산중에 홀로피는 야생화, 무인도에서 외롭게 피는 야생화들은 사람들이 오든 안오든 사람들이 와서 봐주든 안봐주든 사람들이 와서 칭찬해주든 칭찬을 안해주든 아무 관계없이, 아무 상관없이 필 때가 되면 외로이 곱게곱게 피었다가 또 때가 되면 아무 뒷말없이 아무 군더더기 불편없이 어디론가 자취를 감추어 버리고 어디론가 사라져버리니 이것이 야생화의 본분이다. 야생화의 고귀이다. 화두참구 공부인들도 첩첩산중의 야생화, 무인도의 야생화와 같다 하겠다. ‘화두참구 정진이 잘 되느냐 안되느냐’만이 마음의 부담이지 공부부담 외에는 남들이 자기를 알아주든 안알아주든 자기 명성이 있든 없든 지위가 있든 없든 모두가 아무 상관없이, 아무 관계없이 오직 화두 일념만이 자기 생의 전부이다. 화두일념 외에는 세상사 모두를 방하착으로만 살아가는 락도자이다. 화두정진만의 락도의 공덕이 자기들 마음에도 가득, 자기들 방안에도 가득, 도량에도 가득, 자기들 가는 곳마다 락도가 가득할 것으로… 첩첩산중에 홀로피는 야생화와 구도자들의 화두 락도는 차이가 없을 것으로… -대혜(大慧, 1089~1163)선사 나옹스님 법문 참으로 몰록 의, 정이 일어난 자라면 마치 은산 철벽 속에 갇힌 사람이 오로지 살 길을 찾으려고 애쓰듯 해야 한다. 만약 살 길을 찾지 못하면 편안할 수가 있겠는가? 다만 이렇게 공부를 지어갈 것이니 때가 되면 철벽은 저절로 무너지게 될 것이다. 화두에 의, 정을 크게 일으켜 빈틈없게 하고 심신을 하나의 의심덩어리로 만들어 화두 의, 정만 참구할 것이다.",

    "title": "기도법회 의미",
    "content":"기도와 불공의 의미 불공이란 부처님께 공양을 올리는 것을 말하며, 기도란 말 그대로 ‘빈다’는 뜻을 가지고 있습니다. 흔히들 불공과 기도를 같은 의미로 보고 있는 것은 불공과 기도가 함께 이루어지고 있기 때문입니다. 그러므로 살아가면서 어려움에 부딪혔을 때나 원하고 있는 간절한 소망이 있을 때 흔히 불공을 올린다 또는 기도를 한다고 표현합니다. 중생계의 인간은 능력의 한계를 가지고 있기 때문에 무엇인가에 의지하고자 하고, 또한 하소연하고 벗어나고자 기도를 올립니다. 불교에서는 인간에게 일어나는 고난, 장애, 재앙은 다 자신이 날 적부터 지닌 업보와 업장으로 인한 것으로, 진실로 부처님께 의지하여 참회하고 불공을 올려 기도함으로써 업장이 소멸된다고 합니다. 이를 부처님 또는 제불보살님의 가피력이라 하는데 이 가피력을 입고자 불공기도를 하는 것입니다. 재일의 유래 빔비사라왕은 외도들이 포살하는 것을 보고는 부러워하며 우리도 그렇게 하도록 부처님께 청하였습니다. “지금 이 성에 있는 범지(바라문)들이 매월 세 차례 8일, 15일에 모이는데 두루 왕래하면서 서로 친구가 되어 음식을 대접하나이다. 바라옵건데 세존이시어 비구들에게 분부하시어 달마다 세 차례 모이게 하시고 여러 사람들이 두루두루 왕래하면서 서로 친구가 되어 음식을 대접하게 하옵소서. 나와 여러 신하들도 와서 모이겠나이다.” 그 때에 부처님께서 잠자코 빔비사라왕의 말을 받아들이시니 왕은 부처님께서 자신의 말을 승낙하시는 것을 보고 자리에서 일어나 머리를 숙여 발에 예배하고 세 번 돌은 뒤에 물러갔습니다. 이것이 재일의 유례입니다. 이 때 8, 14, 15일은 인도의 달력법 상에 한 달을 둘로 나누어 구분하고 있으므로 실제로는 8, 14, 15, 23, 29, 30이 됩니다. 이것이 6재일의 기원입니다. 그리고 이 재일에는 재가자들도 출가수행자와 함께 수행하도록 권합니다. 그 가운데서 14일과 15일, 29일과 30일이 잇달아 있는 것은 보름단위로 계목을 읽으면서 자기각 받은 계를 잘 지켜가고 있는가를 점검하는 포살일이기 때문입니다. 포살은 보름마다 동일한 지역 내에 거주하는 출가자들이 한 곳에 모여 지난 보름 간의 자기 행위를 반성하고 죄가 있으면 참회하는 의식입니다. 이 날에 동참하는 재가자는 8가지 계를 받아야 하는데, 그 8가지 계를 8관재계라 말합니다. 8관재계는 5계에다 3가지를 더한 것입니다. 그 세 가지는 높고 넓은 침상을 쓰지 않고, 노래하고 춤추지 않고, 일부러 그것을 구경하지도 않으며 향수 등을 바르지 않고, 정오가 지나서 음식을 먹지 않는 것을 말합니다. 이 6재일을 살펴보면 부처님 당시에 재가불자들의 신행생활이 얼마나 철저하였는가를 알 수 있습니다. “목숨은 번개같이 없어지나니 재 하는 날에 마음을 꾸짖고 몸을 삼가고 입을 다물지어다. 재하는 날에는 제천에서 사람의 선과 악을 살피느니라. 만일 한 계율을 지닌 이는 다선 선신으로 호위케하고, 다섯 계율을 지닌 이는 스물 다섯 선신으로 문호를 호위케 하여 흉역과 사마와 음모를 소멸하고 밤에는 나쁜 꿈을 없애며, 관재와 도적과 물불의 재변도 끝내 해롭히지 못하게 한다. 재앙을 물리치고 괴변을 소멸하기는 오직 이 사무량심과 4계와 6재 뿐이니 마치 많은 물과 적은 불을 끄는 것과 같다. 어찌 소멸치 못할 것이 있겠느냐?” «잡아함경 불설사천왕경» 재일에는 천신이 내려와 그 선악을 살핀다고 하였으니 특히 재일에는 가히 파계하지 못했으리라 짐작됩니다. 이러한 6재일에 대한 불교의 전통이 차차 변하여 10재일로 바뀌었습니다. 10재일은 6재일에다 1일, 18일, 24일, 28일을 더한 것이며 각 재일에 특정한 불보살을 배대하여 의미를 두었습니다. 각 재일에 배대된 불보살을 보면 1일은 정광불, 8일은 약사여래, 14일은 , 15일은 18일은 지장보살, 23일은 대력지보살, 24일은 관세음보살, 28일은 29일은 30일은 입니다. 이것을 10재일불이라 부릅니다. 우리나라에서도 10재일을 지킨 흔적이 남아 있어 현재에는 지장재일과 관음재일이 가장 보편적으로 지켜지고 있습니다. 제례의식 불교 제례의식은 차례상에 술과 고기류 대신 차와 과일, 떡, 나물 등으로 검소하게 마련합니다. 상차림은 첫 줄에 과일과 과자를, 둘째 줄은 나물류와 식혜, 셋째 줄은 채소, 탕류, 넷째 줄은 전, 송편과 차를, 다섯째 줄은 밥, 국 등의 순으로 진설하면 됩니다. 그리고 차례상 좌우를 국화 등 현란하지 않은 꽃으로 장엄하고, 진을 올릴 때는 녹차로 준비하고 위패, 제물 등 모든 준비가 갖추어지면 향을 사르며 무릎을 꿇고 앉아 제례를 시작합니다. 불교에서 행하는 차례의식은 부처님에 대한 예경과 찬탄하는 과정, 영가를 모시는 과정, 영가에게 부처림 법문을 들려주는 과정, 영가에게 차와 음식을 공양하는 과정, 발원과 함께 회향하는 과정으로 이루어집니다. 엄밀하게 말하면 불교의 차례에는 영혼을 위로하는데 그치지 않고 조상들의 영혼을 부처님 앞으로 인도하여 모든 장애가 소멸될 것을 기원하는 의미가 담겨있습니다.",

    "content":"The beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates. The phenological or ecological definition of spring relates to biological indicators, such as the blossoming of a range of plant species, the activities of animals, and the special smell of soil that has reached the temperature for micro flora to flourish. These indicators, along with the beginning of spring, vary according to the local climate and according to the specific weather of a particular year. Most ecologists divide the year into six seasons that have no fixed dates. In addition to spring, ecological reckoning identifies an earlier separate prevernal (early or pre-spring) season between the hibernal (winter) and vernal (spring) seasons. This is a time when only the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom, sometimes while there is still some snowcover on the ground. Our Board Members During early spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly, causing new plant growth to “spring forth,” giving the season its name.",

    "title": "Opening Speech by Head of Civil Service at Digital Government Exchange 2017",
    "content":"3 May 2017, Wednesday, 9.05am Asian Civilisations Museum Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning, and a warm welcome to the Digital Government Exchange (DGX) 2017, especially to our overseas guests who have flown in for this event. The inaugural DGX held last year was well received, and we were encouraged by views from participants who found it insightful. This motivated us to continue with it this year. I had the privilege of interacting with some of our foreign delegates last year, and I am happy to see them return, along with new faces and countries who have joined us this year. Singapore began our Smart Nation journey in late 2014. It has been an exciting journey, chiefly because there is no proven strategy to follow. I believe many share this sentiment, which is why we need to learn from each other. DGX is one way to bring together fellow travellers to exchange ideas, celebrate successes, and just as importantly – to learn from ideas that perhaps did not work. The theme of this year’s DGX is “Seizing the Opportunities of Digital Disruption”. Digital disruption is a term many of us are familiar with, but how exactly does it apply to governments? How do digital governments remain competitive in this realm given we have no obvious competitors? Do our existing models still work, and how cost-effective are they? Should we scale up our projects, or keep them small? There are no right answers to these questions, but I am sure that the discussions over the next two days will yield fruitful insights. Reorganising for Better Integration and Responsiveness For Singapore, this year’s DGX is significant for another reason. It is the second day of work for our new Smart Nation and Digital Govement Office. Set up on 1 May 2017, the new outfit draws together the planning and policy teams from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications and Information, and the Smart Nation Programme Office. Together with GovTech, the implementing agency, they form the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (or SNDGG), which will be housed within the Prime Minister’s Office. The main reason for this re-organisation is to enable the Government to be more integrated and responsive in our strategy and processes for Smart Nation and Digital Government. As the central agency, SNDGG will be responsible for: a) Applying digital and smart technologies to improve citizens’ lives in key domains like transportation; b) Delivering digital enablers and platforms for Smart Nation, such as enhancing data sharing and driving the development of a national digital identity framework, and a national sensor communication backbone; and c) Driving digital transformation for the public service, to strengthen government ICT infrastructure and improve public service delivery. While SNDGG’s work is cross-cutting in nature, agencies will still own and maintain the bulk of digital services. Agencies are after all the domain experts, and should be supported through infrastructure and policies. This model reflects our belief that progress is best achieved somewhere between centralisation and decentralisation, and I am sure this balance is one that many governments are trying to strike as well. Digital government and digital services are the focus of DGX, as well as the rest of my speech. Before I go on, let me share my personal reaction to the re-organisation. News reports have described it as an acceleration to Singapore’s Smart Nation efforts, and I find this fitting. Though expectations are high, I am confident that SNDGG can and will bring momentum to our digital ambitions. Becoming a More Data-driven Government A Digital Government is one that is data-driven. The Singapore Government needs to better collect, use, and share the data that we have and in responsible ways, in order to improve how we serve citizens and businesses. A single data point by itself says little, but many data points can go as far as to inform policies. There are many sources of useful data, from administrative data to sensor data to the so-called ‘data exhaust’ of our online transactions. As more people interact with the Government through websites and mobile applications, we need to ensure that they provide a reliable user experience. Earlier, I mentioned that most Government services are available online. This percentage is near 90%, which is not surprising, as Singapore consumers are among the most connected in the world. To know if our websites and digital services are performing well, we will implement Whole-of-Government Application Analytics or WOGAA from next month, to enable real-time and automatic monitoring of all Government websites and digital services. With WOGAA, we aim to ensure good performance of digital services delivery, and identify gaps for improvement. The Government is also working on a Smart Nation Sensor Platform or SNSP. This nationwide sensor platform enables agencies to collect, analyse, and share data from sensors that are deployed island wide. The platform encompasses hardware like lampposts and public cameras, as well as software that enables sensor data exchange, and data and video analytics. As part of this endeavour, we aim to make all 110,000 lampposts in our entire country an interconnected network of wireless sensors. Data from the sensors will be used for urban and operational planning, as well as to ensure prompt maintenance and incident response. For instance, residential areas can have smart metering that provides real-time information on households’ utility consumption, and public transport can be planned or adjusted based on the number of vehicles in a particular area. Another exciting possibility is having lampposts ‘communicate’ with connected cars, to alert drivers when an ambulance or pedestrians are nearby. To improve data exchange within the public service, the Singapore Government is implementing an API Exchange or APEX. A network of data “pipes and gates”, APEX lets agencies share data through secure application programming interfaces or APIs, while centrally monitoring and managing the security of these exchanges. APEX is our answer to connecting disparate systems used by different agencies. It will help us to avoid some costs in the long run, as agencies do not have to build entire services from scratch. Not only will it be easier to reuse existing infrastructure, development time can be shortened too. Of course, the best tools mean nothing if users cannot extract value from them. This is why the Singapore Government is looking to grow our data science capabilities. GovTech has kickstarted its collaboration with the National University of Singapore to train 2,000 public officers in data science every year – senior officials included. The rationale for this is clear: we want to build a Public Service where everyone is conversant in data, from the fresh hires to senior leaders. In fact, we envisage that our daily work should be a digitally immersive and data-rich experience. We are also growing a cadre of data scientists within a Centre of Excellence in GovTech who are increasingly adopting machine and deep learning techniques to solve real world problems. Within its Data Science Centre of Excellence, GovTech will explore the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver more anticipatory public services, with a focus on harnessing sensor data, enhancing cybersecurity, public safety, and customer experience. We are interested in high impact applications of AI, such as using speech and text to change the way citizens use government digital services, and to help enforcement officials harness diverse data sources to more effectively and quickly complete their investigations. Partnering with the Private Sector But the Government cannot build a Smart Nation on our own. Every day, more people interact and transact with commercial entities than with us, which is why it makes sense to partner with the private sector. It will be the best of both worlds: businesses bring their best practices, while the Government helps through regulations and building platforms. A good example of this is our collaboration with the banking sector for the MyInfo bank pilot. Last year, I announced the launch of this digital personal data platform, which allows Singapore residents to auto-fill details like their name, identity card number, and registered residential address onto online forms, instead of repeating them or submitting supporting documents. Since last year, the take-up for MyInfo has grown to approximately 145,000 users. I am happy to update that from today, the use of MyInfo will be extended to the private sector, namely four banks – the Development Bank of Singapore, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Standard Chartered Bank, and United Overseas Bank. What this means is that customers will be able to open bank accounts, without having to submit copies of identity cards and income statements. This way, there is no need for bank staff to manually verify the customer’s details, since they have already been verified by the Government. Not only will this save time, data entry errors will be reduced too. Though the pilot is still ongoing, the Government has plans for MyInfo to be extended beyond the opening of bank accounts by 2018, to other transactions, such as credit card applications and home loans. In tandem with the extension of MyInfo for private sector use, we will also increase the platform’s coverage of government digital services over seven-fold, from 19 government digital services today, to more than 150 by next year. We envision that MyInfo will be used in other sectors with strong citizen touch points, such as insurance. E-payments is another area where the Government welcomes private sector involvement. We cannot push for e-payments by ourselves, and will need to work with external parties – from banks to payment service providers to FinTech firms. An example is the Central Addressing Scheme or CAS, which will be launched at the end of next month. CAS is an industry project led by the Association of Banks in Singapore, and developed by a local payment infrastructure provider, called Banking Computing Services. Customers of seven major banks will be able to use CAS when it is launched. Besides those already involved in the MyInfo pilot, there are HSBC, Citibank, and Maybank as well. CAS links an individual’s mobile number, or National Registration Identity Card number, to their bank account, so inter-bank fund transfers can be made as easy as sending a text. Such convenience will make e-payments more appealing to citizens, especially those who struggle to remember lengthy bank account numbers. Over time, the Government expects CAS to help increase the volume of digital transactions in Singapore. The Government has also put in enablers to promote innovation and experimentation in the private sector. In November last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued “regulatory sandbox” guidelines, enabling financial institutions and FinTech players to conduct live experiments within boundaries, in lieu of meeting full regulatory requirements upfront. The sandbox provides a conducive space to jumpstart testing of innovative solutions, while containing potential fallouts within the agreed boundaries. Conclusion Re-organising, becoming data-driven, and partnering with the private sector – these are just some of the things the Singapore Government is doing to hasten our Smart Nation and Digital Government ambition. I look forward to hearing from all participants, on where you are in your respective digitalisation journeys. I trust that many of our exchanges will spark ideas for future collaborations. I wish everyone a productive DGX, and a very pleasant stay in Singapore. Thank you.",

Such convenience will make e-payments more appealing to citizens, especially those who struggle to remember lengthy bank account numbers. Over time, the Government expects CAS to help increase the volume of digital transactions in Singapore. The Government has also put in enablers to promote innovation and experimentation in the private sector. In November last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued “regulatory sandbox” guidelines, enabling financial institutions and FinTech players to conduct live experiments within boundaries, in lieu of meeting full regulatory requirements upfront. The sandbox provides a conducive space to jumpstart testing of innovative solutions, while containing potential fallouts within the agreed boundaries. Conclusion Re-organising, becoming data-driven, and partnering with the private sector – these are just some of the things the Singapore Government is doing to hasten our Smart Nation and Digital Government ambition. I look forward to hearing from all participants, on where you are in your respective digitalisation journeys. I trust that many of our exchanges will spark ideas for future collaborations. I wish everyone a productive DGX, and a very pleasant stay in Singapore. Thank you.",

    "content":"26 September 2017, Tuesday, 9am Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre Mr Pedro Conceicao, Director of Strategy Policy, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, UNDP Mr Taavi Roivas, former Prime Minister of Estonia, and Ms Maria Robertson, Deputy Chief Executive of Service Delivery and Operations, New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning. A lot has changed in Singapore over the past year: we rolled out Facebook Workplace across government, witnessed the launch of Amazon Prime Now, brought local productions into Netflix, and facilitated the opening of Google’s first Cloud servers in Southeast Asia. The public sector also welcomed the beta release of the New OneMap. Built by SLA entirely in-house, the New OneMap is now the most authoritative and user-friendly source of geospatial data in Singapore. It serves as the common platform for government agencies to deliver geospatial information and services, and brings us one step closer toward Smart Nation. The Ethos of Smart Nation In the execution of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative we have three major objectives. First, we will improve our citizens’ everyday convenience and their quality of life. Second, we will drive greater enterprise efficacy and support new areas of innovation. Third, the expectation, and correctly so, is for us to be inclusive for all Singaporeans from the start. The benefits of our Smart Nation have to be widely distributed and not available to a select few. Thus any platforms we build must not just adopt the most advanced technologies, they must also be publicly-accessible and interoperable. This is important because as a government, we are building platforms not for profit, but for delivering a public good. Our platforms must also have tangible use cases and benefits, such as providing more efficient and tailored services, and have measurable improvements that citizens can see and feel. At the back-end, we have to design it in a way that we can derive and develop, and leverage on enabling deeper policy analysis. So that each platform, each product and each service needs to build on the rest of the ecosystem, accelerating and deepening the development of our Smart Nation in a synergistic approach, with each rollout. But the most important consideration of all is that our platforms must continue to maintain the longstanding trust that Singaporeans have in their government and public services. Without this, we are not going to get much done, let alone transform our nation and our society. There are some key issues that have to be tackled upfront to ensure the effectiveness of our vision – issues that we have to get right, and we have to deal with these issues in a cohesive manner. Our success in addressing the challenges within them will drive the implementation and adoption of the Smart Nation initiatives. These three key issues are data, a willingness to restructure and a focus on the user experience. Data as an Enabler Data is a key enabler that underpins our Smart Nation efforts. That is why for the past year, we have been designing a data sharing framework that will boost inter-agency collaboration to improve the design, integration and delivery of public services, while introducing legal safeguards to maintain the longstanding public trust towards the government’s use of data. Soon, we will be formalising a robust public sector data architecture that will accelerate our Smart Nation journey. We are also enhancing ways that we share data with the public. We have come a long way with our open data platform, Data.gov.sg. Earlier this year, we introduced our Open Data License to welcome more citizen involvement by simplifying the terms and lowering the barriers of using public sector data. We have also continued to provide more granular, machine readable and API accessible datasets for users. If we are to develop new solutions, new ideas and even new platforms to help us solve policy issues, we need more participation and co-creation. So if you have not looked at Data.gov.sg recently, please have a look, and join in. Being Creative about Government Platforms A willingness to restructure and be creative in the way that we develop the platforms to better meet the needs of our citizens is vital. We are studying ways to transform how our services and information are organised, how we can better address our citizens’ needs and to provide them with a seamless experience when interacting with government. We have been successful with creating applications like OneService, which provides a centralised platform for collecting citizen feedback for close to 30 agencies and Town Councils. The application has enhanced our ability to monitor service quality and coordinate improvements, so we want to extend this approach to a broader range of services. One of the projects we are currently looking at is the Moments of Life initiative, which bundles services and information to citizens at different key life moments, such as when they start a family, or around housing, schooling and even health. How can we push, pull, coordinate and collaborate so that a particular service for the citizen is tailored to their needs and is as friction-free as possible? We are exploring the development of this digital service for citizens and an initial version will be made available by the middle of next year. Delivering New User Experiences We have to continually focus on the experience of the users – our citizens. There is a need to improve the convenience and safety of online transactions. Our daily transactions have become more digitised and increasingly performed on mobile devices. We need to also design these experiences to be more intuitive, secure and hassle-free. Realising this, we have started to build the National Digital Identity to enhance everyday online experiences. Last year, we gave SingPass users an opportunity to try out a new government service known as MyInfo – a secure portal that allows users to manage their personal data online. We created the service to help reduce the hassle of filling up online applications, and to provide government-verified data for transactions that require SingPass authentication. MyInfo users will therefore save the trouble of entering the same information repeatedly, or uploading personal documents. The response has been very encouraging: in just over a year, we have received 200,000 sign-ups and successfully extended this service to the banking sector. I am very happy to announce today our next step towards strengthening our National Digital Identity. After a successful trial, all SingPass users will receive a MyInfo profile by the end of this year. After logging in with your SingPass to any participating online government service, such as an application for a new flat, all of your basic personal information including your name, NRIC and date of birth will be filled in automatically. With this expansion of MyInfo, every SingPass user will get the added convenience of just confirming their pre-filled information when transacting with selected online government services. In fact, because this information has already been verified, government agencies will no longer require you to upload a scan of your IC or a proof-of-address. We envision MyInfo to be a key part of our “Tell Us Once” ecosystem, and we see this as a key enabler of our Smart Nation initiative. However, for transactions that involve personal financial information, such as your CPF or income tax records, further steps such as providing consent will still be needed before the transaction can continue. This will reduce the convenience available, but will ensure security and trust around the most sensitive issues. Thus we will always work to strike the right balance, between convenience and security. I am also very excited to announce today that we are looking to extend the use of MyInfo to businesses by the end of this year. We have been piloting our Proof-of-Concept with DBS, OCBC, UOB and Standard Chartered Bank for the past 5 months, and users have been able to use MyInfo for 19 different banking services, such as opening a new bank account or applying for a new credit card. After providing consent to share data from MyInfo, users save the hassle of entering their personal information or uploading personal documents. We believe that MyInfo, and the future National Digital Identity framework, will transform the way our citizens transact online, and the number of services that support it will grow. Using Platforms in the Public Service Since our Smart Nation vision was launched in 2014, we have had ideas for many different types of platforms: platforms for better service delivery, platforms for citizen engagement and platforms for improved data distribution. Some of these ideas have crystalised into products, like MyInfo. Others have become our five Strategic National Projects, which includes the National Digital Identity framework, our E-Payments platform, the Smart Nation Sensor Platform, the Smart Urban Mobility initiative and the Moments of Life initiative. These projects will form the core infrastructure that drive pervasive adoption of digital and smart technologies throughout the economy and society. We have to be wholly inclusive to all Singaporeans from the start, designing products and services with the user as an integral part of the process. These have to be interoperable with the public and the private sector, because ultimately, the Smart Nation journey has to generate benefits for the economy, businesses and jobs in Singapore. Thank you very much.",

    "content":"SINGAPORE, 10 Nov 2017 – Businesses and developers can now offer simpler and hassle-free digital services to their customers by tapping on the government’s MyInfo service. Launched today, the MyInfo Developer &amp; Partner Portal, as a next step towards building a vibrant ecosystem for the National Digital Identity (NDI), provides businesses with the necessary resources to integrate their digital services with MyInfo. This move sets Singapore apart as one of the first governments in the world to enable businesses to access consent-driven citizen data for easier integration into their applications. This is in line with the Smart Nation objectives of facilitating greater collaboration between Government and private sector, to create better efficiencies for businesses and a more intuitive user experience for their customers. The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) is introducing this portal on the back of the well-received MyInfo bank pilot. The earlier pilot has helped bank users do away with the need to submit supporting documents, such as NRIC scans or proof of address, ensuring greater convenience and faster transaction times when opening new bank accounts and applying for credit cards. Banks also reported an average decrease of up to 80 per cent in application time for their customers, with some seeing up to 15 per cent higher approval rate due to MyInfo’s better data quality. Verified data streamlines business processes “We’ve been observing how citizens transact with government, and what it takes to reduce the hassle on their part. With MyInfo made available to a wider range of business transactions, we can help remove the need to verify documents, and even reduce time spent on face-to-face meetings. This significantly improves business efficiency as companies can on-board their customers faster.” CHAN CHEOW HOE, GOVERNMENT CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, GOVTECH Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Information Officer, GovTech, said, “We’ve been observing how citizens transact with government, and what it takes to reduce the hassle on their part. With MyInfo made available to a wider range of business transactions, we can help remove the need to verify documents, and even reduce time spent on face-to-face meetings. This significantly improves business efficiency as companies can on-board their customers faster.” The provision of government-verified digital data also ensures greater accuracy in the information provided to the companies. The security and privacy of citizen data remains a key priority, similar to the bank pilot, businesses will need to seek consent from customers at the point of every transaction before any data is released for their use. Keen interest from industry Following news of the bank pilot, GovTech has received strong interest from more than 100 businesses in various business sectors including telecommunications, utilities, banking and finance on how they can tap on MyInfo for faster transactions with their customers. “We are very excited to use MyInfo to deliver frictionless, cashless transactions for both consumers and merchants. The MyInfo platform will optimise the onboarding process of our hawker partners by streamlining KYC documentation and verification, enabling them to quickly and easily accept e-money. This is in line with Smart Nation and we are pleased to be part of the rapidly evolving cashless payments ecosystem,” said Jeremy Tan, founder and CEO of Liquid Group. The portal will also benefit developers as it offers a sandbox environment for them to build solutions faster. Developers can access the sandbox at https://myinfo-api.app.gov.sg to find out how to prototype their services. Locally-registered businesses can log in with their CorpPass credentials from December 2017 onwards. Please see Annex A for the quotes from participating banks and users. What is MyInfo? MyInfo is a service for SingPass users to manage the use of their personal data when transacting online with participating government agencies and commercial entities. MyInfo users can skip filling in personal data repeatedly for every digital transaction, while enjoying greater convenience from producing fewer verification documents. MyInfo was extended to the banking sector in May 2017, with four banks piloting the use of MyInfo for opening of new bank accounts and application of credit cards.",

    "content":"More than 80 per cent of businesses that have regular transactions with the Government have registered for and started using Singapore Corporate Access (CorpPass), to better protect and manage their corporate data. CorpPass is another initiative which demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to create better efficiencies and a more secure digital ecosystem for businesses to thrive in a Smart Nation. The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) expects more than 250,000 active businesses to use CorpPass, which will be the only login method for online corporate transactions with the Government from Q3 2018. The majority of businesses are now CorpPass-ready. Businesses that have not registered for CorpPass should do so as existing login methods, such as SingPass and EASY, will cease by then. CorpPass will also be made available to foreign businesses in 2018. “I had participated in the pilot use of the CorpPass system and given feedback as a trial user. The basic setup is user-friendly, and I have even managed to guide my OEM client through it with the help of a demo on Facebook. It helped that resources were readily available in the form of online materials and public briefings.” MR KELVIN TAN One early adopter of CorpPass is Mr Kelvin Tan, who is working in a family-owned SME dealing with bottled food products. Mr Tan said, “I had participated in the pilot use of the CorpPass system and given feedback as a trial user. The basic setup is user-friendly, and I have even managed to guide my OEM client through it with the help of a demo on Facebook. It helped that resources were readily available in the form of online materials and public briefings.” Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Information Officer, GovTech said, “CorpPass is designed for all businesses, from multi-national companies to SMEs, and allows for greater data security, better control and enhanced convenience for business users when they transact with the Government. We are glad that the majority of businesses have started using CorpPass and strongly urge the rest to do so now.” Industry partners, such as the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), have also been supportive in promoting CorpPass to their members. Mr Koh Juan Kiat, Executive Director of SNEF, shared, “We saw the merits of having a digital identity for business transactions. We have been working with GovTech, and will continue to do so, to raise awareness and encourage our members to sign up early, to enjoy the convenience and security of using more than 130 Government digital services. In addition to the existing suite of digital services managed by over 50 Government agencies, businesses can transact with Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) using CorpPass by Q3 2018.

    "content":"3 May 2017, Wednesday, 9.05am Asian Civilisations Museum Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning, and a warm welcome to the Digital Government Exchange (DGX) 2017, especially to our overseas guests who have flown in for this event. The inaugural DGX held last year was well received, and we were encouraged by views from participants who found it insightful. This motivated us to continue with it this year. I had the privilege of interacting with some of our foreign delegates last year, and I am happy to see them return, along with new faces and countries who have joined us this year. Singapore began our Smart Nation journey in late 2014. It has been an exciting journey, chiefly because there is no proven strategy to follow. I believe many share this sentiment, which is why we need to learn from each other. DGX is one way to bring together fellow travellers to exchange ideas, celebrate successes, and just as importantly – to learn from ideas that perhaps did not work. The theme of this year’s DGX is “Seizing the Opportunities of Digital Disruption”. Digital disruption is a term many of us are familiar with, but how exactly does it apply to governments? How do digital governments remain competitive in this realm given we have no obvious competitors? Do our existing models still work, and how cost-effective are they? Should we scale up our projects, or keep them small? There are no right answers to these questions, but I am sure that the discussions over the next two days will yield fruitful insights. Reorganising for Better Integration and Responsiveness For Singapore, this year’s DGX is significant for another reason. It is the second day of work for our new Smart Nation and Digital Govement Office. Set up on 1 May 2017, the new outfit draws together the planning and policy teams from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications and Information, and the Smart Nation Programme Office. Together with GovTech, the implementing agency, they form the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (or SNDGG), which will be housed within the Prime Minister’s Office. The main reason for this re-organisation is to enable the Government to be more integrated and responsive in our strategy and processes for Smart Nation and Digital Government. As the central agency, SNDGG will be responsible for: a) Applying digital and smart technologies to improve citizens’ lives in key domains like transportation; b) Delivering digital enablers and platforms for Smart Nation, such as enhancing data sharing and driving the development of a national digital identity framework, and a national sensor communication backbone; and c) Driving digital transformation for the public service, to strengthen government ICT infrastructure and improve public service delivery. While SNDGG’s work is cross-cutting in nature, agencies will still own and maintain the bulk of digital services. Agencies are after all the domain experts, and should be supported through infrastructure and policies. This model reflects our belief that progress is best achieved somewhere between centralisation and decentralisation, and I am sure this balance is one that many governments are trying to strike as well. Digital government and digital services are the focus of DGX, as well as the rest of my speech. Before I go on, let me share my personal reaction to the re-organisation. News reports have described it as an acceleration to Singapore’s Smart Nation efforts, and I find this fitting. Though expectations are high, I am confident that SNDGG can and will bring momentum to our digital ambitions. Becoming a More Data-driven Government A Digital Government is one that is data-driven. The Singapore Government needs to better collect, use, and share the data that we have and in responsible ways, in order to improve how we serve citizens and businesses. A single data point by itself says little, but many data points can go as far as to inform policies. There are many sources of useful data, from administrative data to sensor data to the so-called ‘data exhaust’ of our online transactions. As more people interact with the Government through websites and mobile applications, we need to ensure that they provide a reliable user experience. Earlier, I mentioned that most Government services are available online. This percentage is near 90%, which is not surprising, as Singapore consumers are among the most connected in the world. To know if our websites and digital services are performing well, we will implement Whole-of-Government Application Analytics or WOGAA from next month, to enable real-time and automatic monitoring of all Government websites and digital services. With WOGAA, we aim to ensure good performance of digital services delivery, and identify gaps for improvement. The Government is also working on a Smart Nation Sensor Platform or SNSP. This nationwide sensor platform enables agencies to collect, analyse, and share data from sensors that are deployed island wide. The platform encompasses hardware like lampposts and public cameras, as well as software that enables sensor data exchange, and data and video analytics. As part of this endeavour, we aim to make all 110,000 lampposts in our entire country an interconnected network of wireless sensors. Data from the sensors will be used for urban and operational planning, as well as to ensure prompt maintenance and incident response. For instance, residential areas can have smart metering that provides real-time information on households’ utility consumption, and public transport can be planned or adjusted based on the number of vehicles in a particular area. Another exciting possibility is having lampposts ‘communicate’ with connected cars, to alert drivers when an ambulance or pedestrians are nearby. To improve data exchange within the public service, the Singapore Government is implementing an API Exchange or APEX. A network of data “pipes and gates”, APEX lets agencies share data through secure application programming interfaces or APIs, while centrally monitoring and managing the security of these exchanges. APEX is our answer to connecting disparate systems used by different agencies. It will help us to avoid some costs in the long run, as agencies do not have to build entire services from scratch. Not only will it be easier to reuse existing infrastructure, development time can be shortened too. Of course, the best tools mean nothing if users cannot extract value from them. This is why the Singapore Government is looking to grow our data science capabilities. GovTech has kickstarted its collaboration with the National University of Singapore to train 2,000 public officers in data science every year – senior officials included. The rationale for this is clear: we want to build a Public Service where everyone is conversant in data, from the fresh hires to senior leaders. In fact, we envisage that our daily work should be a digitally immersive and data-rich experience. We are also growing a cadre of data scientists within a Centre of Excellence in GovTech who are increasingly adopting machine and deep learning techniques to solve real world problems. Within its Data Science Centre of Excellence, GovTech will explore the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver more anticipatory public services, with a focus on harnessing sensor data, enhancing cybersecurity, public safety, and customer experience. We are interested in high impact applications of AI, such as using speech and text to change the way citizens use government digital services, and to help enforcement officials harness diverse data sources to more effectively and quickly complete their investigations. Partnering with the Private Sector But the Government cannot build a Smart Nation on our own. Every day, more people interact and transact with commercial entities than with us, which is why it makes sense to partner with the private sector. It will be the best of both worlds: businesses bring their best practices, while the Government helps through regulations and building platforms. A good example of this is our collaboration with the banking sector for the MyInfo bank pilot. Last year, I announced the launch of this digital personal data platform, which allows Singapore residents to auto-fill details like their name, identity card number, and registered residential address onto online forms, instead of repeating them or submitting supporting documents. Since last year, the take-up for MyInfo has grown to approximately 145,000 users. I am happy to update that from today, the use of MyInfo will be extended to the private sector, namely four banks – the Development Bank of Singapore, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Standard Chartered Bank, and United Overseas Bank. What this means is that customers will be able to open bank accounts, without having to submit copies of identity cards and income statements. This way, there is no need for bank staff to manually verify the customer’s details, since they have already been verified by the Government. Not only will this save time, data entry errors will be reduced too. Though the pilot is still ongoing, the Government has plans for MyInfo to be extended beyond the opening of bank accounts by 2018, to other transactions, such as credit card applications and home loans. In tandem with the extension of MyInfo for private sector use, we will also increase the platform’s coverage of government digital services over seven-fold, from 19 government digital services today, to more than 150 by next year. We envision that MyInfo will be used in other sectors with strong citizen touch points, such as insurance. E-payments is another area where the Government welcomes private sector involvement. We cannot push for e-payments by ourselves, and will need to work with external parties – from banks to payment service providers to FinTech firms. An example is the Central Addressing Scheme or CAS, which will be launched at the end of next month. CAS is an industry project led by the Association of Banks in Singapore, and developed by a local payment infrastructure provider, called Banking Computing Services. Customers of seven major banks will be able to use CAS when it is launched. Besides those already involved in the MyInfo pilot, there are HSBC, Citibank, and Maybank as well. CAS links an individual’s mobile number, or National Registration Identity Card number, to their bank account, so inter-bank fund transfers can be made as easy as sending a text. Such convenience will make e-payments more appealing to citizens, especially those who struggle to remember lengthy bank account numbers. Over time, the Government expects CAS to help increase the volume of digital transactions in Singapore. The Government has also put in enablers to promote innovation and experimentation in the private sector. In November last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued “regulatory sandbox” guidelines, enabling financial institutions and FinTech players to conduct live experiments within boundaries, in lieu of meeting full regulatory requirements upfront. The sandbox provides a conducive space to jumpstart testing of innovative solutions, while containing potential fallouts within the agreed boundaries. Conclusion Re-organising, becoming data-driven, and partnering with the private sector – these are just some of the things the Singapore Government is doing to hasten our Smart Nation and Digital Government ambition. I look forward to hearing from all participants, on where you are in your respective digitalisation journeys. I trust that many of our exchanges will spark ideas for future collaborations. I wish everyone a productive DGX, and a very pleasant stay in Singapore. Thank you.",

    "content":"From delivering digital services to developing Singapore into a Smart Nation, GovTech advocates innovative technology to shape the way business is done in the government. Leading Digital Transformation The world has become so fast paced that people don’t want to stand by reading a page of information, they would much rather look at a presentation and understand the message. It has come to a point where images and videos are used more to promote a product or service and this has extended from businesses to our daily routine. We are all in such a hurry that we wave bye instead of saying “goodbye”, show the watch to point to the time and so on. It is a healthy habit considering how we use our hands and motions to indicate what we are upto or capable of. The Government is in the process of crystallising the next phase of Strategic National Project, and will seek views and perspectives from different sources.",

Co-creation In an inter-connected world where data is open and available to all, citizens and businesses can do a lot to shape how Singapore develops into a Smart Nation. Indeed, it is through your engagement and co-creation that a Smart Nation becomes truly smart. Today, there are several resources to get involved in a digital Singapore. By discovering new insights, sharing feedback and developing apps, many ground-up efforts of users are already shaping Singapore for the future. Tech Kaki Community We want to solve problems. In fact, we want to solve problems with you! At GovTech Singapore, we transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an “outside-in” view, and put users first for our work. Tech Kaki is a community set up by GovTech for citizen participation. As part of this community, you will get first dibs on new tech products before they go live and be part of the development team to make them better. We will publish quick polls and mini surveys regularly. All you have to do is to take a few minutes to answer them. Join us at https://www.facebook.com/TechKaki today! Bug Bounty Program At GovTech, we embrace this “outside-in approach”. Only when we have taken in the views and preferences of citizens and stakeholders can a digital service be considered user-centric. This, we believe, is the way to develop high-quality digital services that matter. This is also why we are asking people to be our Tech Kaki. By joining the community, you get to try out our new tech products and services before they are available. Too many government apps today? That’s alright, we will evaluate the landscape of apps as we move towards addressing the various Moments of Life for citizens. As a user, your insights are valuable in creating digital offerings that are useful to citizens.",
